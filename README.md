## What's Countly?
[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.

## About

This repository includes the Unity SDK. 

Need help? See [Countly SDK for Unity](http://resources.count.ly/v1.0/docs/) documentation at [Countly Resources](http://resources.count.ly), or ask us on our [Countly Analytics Community Slack channel](http://slack.count.ly).
